# Pizza-sales-forcasting
Pizza sales analysis
Analysis is done in python using sqlite  to solve below questions:
•	What is the total pizza sales quantity for each month over the past year, and can you identify any seasonal trends or patterns in the data?
•	What is the average daily pizza sales quantity for each day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.), and how does it vary over time?
•	What is the month-to-month growth rate in pizza sales quantity, and can you identify any periods of significant growth or decline?
•	What are the top N pizza types ordered by customers?
•	Are there any significant differences in pizza sales on holidays or special events compared to regular days, and can you quantify these differences?
•	How has the average pizza order quantity changed over time (e.g., by morning, afternoon, evening, night)?
•	"Build a time series forecasting model in Python to predict pizza sales for the next month, considering historical sales data, seasonality, and any external factors that may influence sales."
